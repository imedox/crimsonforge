"""CrimsonForge version and changelog registry.

Single source of truth for the application version. Every module that needs
the version string imports it from here. The CHANGELOG list is rendered in the
About tab so users (and developers) always see what changed.

VERSION BUMPING RULES
---------------------
- Bump PATCH (1.x.Y) for bug fixes, small tweaks, and safe improvements.
- Bump MINOR (1.X.0) for new features, new tabs, new AI providers, or
  significant workflow changes.
- Bump MAJOR (X.0.0) for breaking changes to project files, settings
  format, or game-patch pipeline.
- Always add a new entry at the TOP of CHANGELOG when changing code.
